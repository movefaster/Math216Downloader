# Math216Downloader
A simple downloader app for Math 216 taught by Prof. Clark Bray at Duke University.

# Build
``mvn clean package`` should suffice. Dependencies will be downloaded automatically and two JARs will be generated in the ``target`` directory: one with dependencies and one with only class files.
